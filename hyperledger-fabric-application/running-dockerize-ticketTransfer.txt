Install these
Docker Desktop, Python, gRPC for Python

------------------------------
The blockchain must be running
------------------------------

Please copy out your Org1 folder before pulling

Once pulled put Org1 back inside

If you didn't do this then you will need to go and copy the certs again. Follow instructions in readme.txt
------------------------------
In terminal 1 run:
In /hyperledger-fabric-application
docker-compose up --build
(It's a server so yes it will look like below)

ticket-transfer-app-container  |
ticket-transfer-app-container  | --> Submit Transaction: InitLedger, function creates the initial set of tickets on the ledger
ticket-transfer-app-container  | *** Transaction committed successfully
ticket-transfer-app-container  | 2024/11/01 19:17:42 Server is running on port :50051

In terminal 2 run:
In /hyperledger-fabric-application
python gRPC-Client-Example.py
(This is the Client code that will run on app.py and the return should look like below)
Ticket Info for ID ticket4: {"TicketID":"ticket4","EventName":"Taylor Swift Eras Tour","TicketCategory":"CAT 3","Owner":"Default","SeatNumber":"12D"}
Transfer Ticket Success: True
Updated Ticket Info for ID ticketId: "ticket4"
: {"TicketID":"ticket4","EventName":"Taylor Swift Eras Tour","TicketCategory":"CAT 3","Owner":"Jake","SeatNumber":"12D"}

If you get any other error then most likely your blockchain is not set up properly or missing gRPC dependencies (most likely Python gRPC stuff)
