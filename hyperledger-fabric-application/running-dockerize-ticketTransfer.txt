Install these
Docker Desktop, Go, Python, gRPC Python and Go and the Blockchain
(Must be run inside of \hyperledger-fabric-application)
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

There is one more thing 
Protocol Buffer (Only Jun Ye knows how)

------------------------------
The blockchain must be running
------------------------------

Please copy out your Org1 folder before pulling

Once pulled put Org1 back inside
------------------------------

Open another terminal in the same directory

In terminal 1 run:
docker-compose up --build
(It's a server so yes it will look like below)

ticket-transfer-app-container  |
ticket-transfer-app-container  | --> Submit Transaction: InitLedger, function creates the initial set of tickets on the ledger
ticket-transfer-app-container  | *** Transaction committed successfully
ticket-transfer-app-container  | 2024/11/01 19:17:42 Server is running on port :50051

In terminal 2 run:
python gRPC-Client-Example.py
(This is the Client code that will run on app.py and the return should look like below)
Ticket Info for ID ticket4: {"TicketID":"ticket4","EventName":"Taylor Swift Eras Tour","TicketCategory":"CAT 3","Owner":"Default","SeatNumber":"12D"}
Transfer Ticket Success: True
Updated Ticket Info for ID ticketId: "ticket4"
: {"TicketID":"ticket4","EventName":"Taylor Swift Eras Tour","TicketCategory":"CAT 3","Owner":"Jake","SeatNumber":"12D"}

If you get any other error then most likely your blockchain is not set up properly or missing gRPC dependencies (most likely the Protocol buffer thing)
